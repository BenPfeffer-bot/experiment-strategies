• For Trending Regimes:

– Long Entry: Signal triggered when a short-term MA crosses above a long-term MA with MACD turned positive and RSI not in overbought territory.

– Short Entry: The reverse – when the short-term MA crosses below the long-term MA, supported by negative MACD and absence of oversold extremes.

• For Range-Bound Conditions (mean-reversion):

– Long Entry: Look for oversold signals (RSI < 30 or price touching the lower Bollinger Band) when price is near the bottom of the range.

– Short Entry: If the RSI is above 70 or price touches an upper boundary, a short signal may be activated.

• Supplementary Entry Confirmation:

– Validate entries with breakout confirmation (e.g., a Fibonacci retracement level is breached) and consider the “distance” of the current price from key reference levels (similar to a delta, in a non-derivatives sense).

– This “smoothing” of the trigger reduces false signals and adds robustness.

Exit Strategies and Trade Management

Exiting positions is as important as entering them. Drawing on both theoretical and practical aspects:

• Pre-Defined Exits:

– Set fixed stop-loss levels based on recent volatility measures (for example, ATR multiples) as a worst-case risk control.

– Establish a profit target based on a desired reward-to-risk ratio (e.g., 2:1).

• Dynamic Trailing Stops:

– Adjust stops as a position moves favorably, locking in gains while still allowing anticipated continuation in a trending regime.

• Time-Based Exits:

– If a trade has not moved into either profit or loss boundaries within a defined period, an exit can be triggered—useful in range-bound periods.

• Regime Change Exits:

– Monitor if the market shifts—for instance, if the regime indicator flips from trending to range, consider an early exit or reduced exposure.
