 6. Integrating Reinforcement Learning (RL)

Drawing inspiration from RL for finance, we can further enhance our systematic strategy:

• Custom Trading Environment:

– Create an environment where states consist of the technical indicators, regime labels, and recent price history.
 – The agent’s actions could include discrete decisions: buy, sell, hold; or even adjust position sizing.

• Reward Function Design:

– Construct a reward function that rewards profitable moves and penalizes excessive drawdowns.

– Incorporate risk management into the reward—for example, reward a trade more if the drawdown risk (the “delta” of the entry relative to volatility) is lower.

• Adaptive Learning:

– Use RL algorithms (like DQN or PPO) to adjust the system’s parameters in real-time.

– The agent learns to optimize entries and exits as well as to adjust trade sizes in response to evolving market regimes.

• Blending with Deterministic Rules:

– The RL layer can serve as an overlay—a dynamic signal tuner or a position sizer—on top of the deterministic entry/exit triggers you developed based on classical technical analysis.

• Backtesting RL Policies:

– Use historical EURO STOXX 50 data to train the agent; validate with walk-forward testing and Monte Carlo simulations inspired by both Davey’s and Hilpisch’s approaches.
