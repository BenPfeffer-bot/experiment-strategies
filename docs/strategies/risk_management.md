 Dynamic Risk Management & Position Sizing

A key insight from Wilmott is the importance of quantifying sensitivity and risk, while Davey stresses preserving capital.

• Position Sizing based on Volatility:

– Use a volatility-adjusted approach (e.g., risk a fixed percentage like 2% of account balance per trade).

– Compute position size as: Position Size = (Account Risk in $) ÷ (Absolute difference between entry and stop-loss); here, the difference is scaled by an ATR or rolling standard deviation.

• Pseudo-“Delta” for Entry Sensitivity:

– Measure how sensitive your signal is to adverse price movements. For example, if the entry trigger (e.g., a moving average crossover) is very marginal in volatile conditions, reduce the trade size.

• Kelly-Criterion Inspired Allocation:

– Balance the potential edge against market volatility, ensuring that drawdowns are contained and the risk/reward remains robust.
