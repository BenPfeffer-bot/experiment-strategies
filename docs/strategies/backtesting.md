Backtesting, Walk-Forward Analysis & Robustness

• Historical Data Preparation:

– Clean and normalize spot price data, compute all relevant technical indicators.

• Modular Code Architecture:

– Structure the system into clear modules: data preparation, regime classification, signal generation, risk management, and RL-based policy adaptation.

• Optimization and Validation:

– Optimize key parameters (MA lengths, ATR multipliers, regime thresholds) using out-of-sample data and robust walk-forward testing approaches.
 – Use Monte Carlo simulation to analyze the strategy’s performance distribution, drawdown probabilities, and risk of ruin.

• Iterative Refinement:

– Continuously calibrate and refine the model as more data becomes available or as the market structure changes over time.
