# Implementation Outline

## Data Preparation and Cleaning

- Import historical daily price data for EURO STOXX 50

- Clean data, adjust for corporate actions if needed

- Calculate technical indicators:

- 20-day and 50-day simple moving averages

- MACD (and signal line)

- RSI (14-day period)

- ATR (14-day period)

- Rolling standard deviation

## Regime Classification Module

- Define a regime score, for example: if (20-day MA > 50-day MA) and MACD > 0, assign “trending up.”

- Otherwise, if the price oscillates around the MA (with relatively low volatile ATR), mark the regime as range-bound.

- Optionally, set quantitative thresholds (e.g., ATR as a % of price) to help decide.

## Signal Generation Module

- For trending regimes:

- Condition for Long Entry: Price has broken above the 20-day MA, confirmed by a MACD cross upward and RSI between 40 and 70.

- Condition for Short Entry: A reverse of above (if trending down)

- For range-bound regimes:

    - Long Entry: When RSI < 30 and price touches lower Bollinger Band

    - Short Entry: When RSI > 70 and price touches the upper Bollinger Band

## Exit Module

- Upon entry, immediately calculate:

    - Fixed stop-loss: e.g., entry price − (ATR × 1.5) for longs

    - Profit target: e.g., a reward-to-risk ratio of 2:1

- Trailing stop: adjust stop-loss if price moves favorably, locking in gains

- Also, monitor regime changes: if the regime shifts (e.g., trending switches to range), consider early exit.

## Risk & Position Sizing Module

- Determine amount to risk per trade (e.g., 2% of current account balance)

- Size position = (Account Risk in $) ÷ (absolute difference between entry and stop-loss)

## Backtesting & Walk-Forward Evaluation

- Use several years (e.g., 10 years) of historical data on EURO STOXX 50 spot prices

- Perform parameter optimization (while guarding against overfitting) using out-of-sample and walk-forward methods

- Optionally perform Monte Carlo simulations to analyze drawdown distribution, risk of ruin, and expectancy
